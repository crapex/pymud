<h1 id="section-1">Contributing to My GitHub Repository: A Guide</h1>
<p>Welcome to my GitHub repository! I’m excited that you’re interested in contributing. This guide will walk you through how to contribute to this project, whether you’re fixing a bug, adding a feature, improving documentation, or asking a question. By following these guidelines, you’ll help maintain a collaborative and efficient workflow. Let’s get started!</p>
<h2 id="section-1">Types of Contributions</h2>
<p>There are many ways to contribute to open source projects – it’s not just about writing code. Here are some examples of how you can help:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Bug Reports:</strong> If you find a bug or unexpected behavior, let me know by opening an issue. Provide steps to reproduce the issue so I can investigate.</li>
<li><strong>Feature Requests:</strong> Have an idea for a new feature or improvement? Open an issue to discuss it. I’ll consider it and we can plan how to implement it.</li>
<li><strong>Code Contributions:</strong> You can fix bugs or implement new features by writing code. This involves forking the repository, making changes, and submitting a pull request (more on that below).</li>
<li><strong>Documentation:</strong> Help improve the documentation, including the README, code comments, or any guides. Good documentation is crucial – even fixing a typo or clarifying a sentence is a valuable contribution.</li>
<li><strong>Testing:</strong> Testing is important too! You can help by writing tests for existing code or testing new changes. If I open a pull request, you can review it and test the changes locally.</li>
<li><strong>Community Support:</strong> You can answer questions on issues or discussion forums, help triage bugs, or organize community resources. Every bit of support helps others get started.</li>
</ul>
<p>As GitHub’s contribution guide notes, <em>“there are all sorts of ways to get involved with an open source project”</em> – you don’t have to be a programmer to contribute<a href="https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">[opensource.guide]</a>. Whether it’s coding, writing, or helping others, your contributions are welcome.</p>
<h2 id="section-2">Finding Something to Work On</h2>
<p>If you’re looking for an issue to work on, a great place to start is the repository’s <strong>Issue Tracker</strong>. I use GitHub Issues to keep track of bugs, feature requests, and tasks. You can filter issues by labels to find something suitable:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Good First Issues:</strong> Issues labeled <code>good first issue</code> are intended for newcomers. They’re usually smaller tasks that are a good way to learn the project. These issues are tagged to make it easier for new contributors to find a starting point<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">[docs.github.com]</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Help Wanted:</strong> Issues labeled <code>help wanted</code> are tasks that the maintainers need assistance with. These might be a bit more involved than first issues, but help is definitely appreciated.</li>
<li>Other labels like <code>bug</code>, <code>enhancement</code>, or <code>documentation</code> can help you find issues in areas you’re interested in (e.g. look for <code>documentation</code> if you want to improve docs).</li>
</ul>
<p>Before jumping into coding, it’s a good idea to <strong>check if an issue already exists</strong> for the problem or feature you’re interested in. If it does, you can comment on that issue to let others know you’d like to work on it. This prevents duplicate work and lets me give you any guidance needed. If no issue exists, feel free to open a new one first to discuss the change (especially for larger features) – this way we can agree on the approach before you spend time coding.</p>
<p>GitHub also makes it easy to discover contribution opportunities. For example, each repository has a <strong>Contribute</strong> page that highlights <code>good first issue</code> and <code>help wanted</code> issues<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/issues/using-labels-and-milestones-to-track-work/managing-labels" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">[docs.github.com]</a>. You can access this by clicking “Contribute” on the repo’s homepage. This is a curated list to welcome new contributors. Additionally, GitHub’s search allows filtering by labels (e.g. <code>label:"good first issue"</code>) to find open issues across projects<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/encouraging-helpful-contributions-to-your-project-with-labels" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">[docs.github.com]</a>. There are also external sites like <strong>goodfirstissue.dev</strong> that aggregate <code>good first issue</code> labels from various projects<a href="https://goodfirstissue.dev/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">[goodfirstissue.dev]</a>.</p>
<p>Don’t hesitate to ask for help if you’re unsure where to start. You can comment on an issue or reach out via the communication channels (discussions, email, etc. – see below) and I’ll be happy to point you in the right direction.</p>
<h2 id="section-3">Communication Channels</h2>
<p>Effective communication is key in open source projects. Here are the primary channels we use for communication, and when to use each:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>GitHub Issues:</strong> Issues are for tracking specific tasks, bugs, or feature requests. Use an issue to report a bug or propose a new feature. Issues are tied to the repository and are great for discussing concrete changes or problems<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/communicating-on-github" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">[docs.github.com]</a>. Every issue should have a clear title and description so everyone understands what it’s about.</li>
<li><strong>GitHub Pull Requests (PRs):</strong> Pull requests are for proposing and reviewing code changes. When you have code you’d like to submit, you’ll open a PR. The PR discussion is where I’ll review your code line by line and suggest changes. Think of PRs as the place to discuss the <em>implementation</em> of a solution. If a PR is linked to an issue, closing that issue will be part of the discussion (often by writing “Fixes #123” in the PR description).</li>
<li><strong>GitHub Discussions:</strong> Discussions are like a forum for the project community. Use discussions for general questions, ideas, or conversations that aren’t specific to a bug or code change<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/communicating-on-github" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">[docs.github.com]</a>. For example, you might start a discussion to ask how to use the project, share a use case, or brainstorm new features in an informal way. Discussions are a good place to get help or share knowledge with other users and contributors.</li>
<li><strong>Other Channels:</strong> Depending on the project, there might be additional channels like a chat room (Slack, Discord), mailing list, or forum. If those exist, they’ll be mentioned in the README or documentation. Typically, <strong>GitHub Issues and Discussions are the main channels</strong> for this project, but if there’s an official chat, that’s where casual conversation and quick questions might happen.</li>
</ul>
<p>To summarize: <strong>use Issues for actionable tasks or bugs</strong>, <strong>use PRs when you have code to submit</strong>, and <strong>use Discussions for open-ended questions or discussions</strong><a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/communicating-on-github" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">[docs.github.com]</a>. This helps keep the project organized. I’ll do my best to respond promptly in these channels. If you’re unsure where to post something, starting an issue or discussion is usually safe – I can always help move the conversation to the right place if needed.</p>
<h2 id="section-4">How to Submit a Pull Request (PR)</h2>
<p>Submitting a pull request is the process of contributing your code changes back to the main repository. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how to do that:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Fork the Repository:</strong> First, create a copy of my repository in your GitHub account by clicking the “Fork” button on the repository’s page. This gives you your own version (<code>https://github.com/your-username/repo-name</code>) where you can make changes freely.</li>
<li><strong>Clone the Repository:</strong> On your local machine, clone your forked repository (using <code>git clone</code>) so you have the code to work on. For example:
                <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/your-username/repo-name.git</code></pre>
<p>This downloads the code to your computer.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Set Up Remotes:</strong> It’s good practice to configure a remote pointing back to the original repository (often called <code>upstream</code>) so you can sync changes. From your local repo directory:
                <pre><code>git remote add upstream https://github.com/my-username/repo-name.git</code></pre>
<p>Now <code>origin</code> points to your fork and <code>upstream</code> points to the original.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Create a Branch:</strong> Before making changes, create a new branch for your work. This keeps your work isolated. For example:
                <pre><code>git checkout -b my-feature-branch</code></pre>
<p>Use a descriptive branch name (like <code>fix-bug-123</code> or <code>add-new-feature</code>).</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Make Changes and Commit:</strong> Edit the files as needed to fix the bug or add the feature. When you’re ready, commit your changes with a clear commit message. For example:
                <pre><code>git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Crash when saving file (resolves #123)"</code></pre>
<p>Keep your commit messages concise but informative – they should explain <em>what</em> the change does and <em>why</em>. (If your commit addresses a specific issue, include the issue number, e.g. “Fix #123”.)</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Push to Your Fork:</strong> Push your branch to your forked repository on GitHub:
                <pre><code>git push origin my-feature-branch</code></pre>
</li>
<li><strong>Open a Pull Request:</strong> Go to <strong>my original repository</strong> on GitHub. You may see a banner suggesting that you open a pull request for the branch you just pushed. If not, navigate to the “Pull Requests” tab and click “New Pull Request”. Select the base branch (usually <code>main</code> or <code>master</code> of the original repo) and the compare branch (your <code>my-feature-branch</code> from your fork). Then click “Create Pull Request”.
                <p>GitHub will bring you to a page where you can enter a title and description for your PR. <strong>Provide a clear title</strong> (e.g. “Fix: Crash when saving file”) and a detailed description of what changes you made and why. If this PR fixes an issue, mention it (e.g. “Fixes #123”). The more context you give, the easier it is for me to review.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Review and Iteration:</strong> Once you open the PR, I will review it. I may ask questions or suggest changes. Please be responsive to comments – you can push additional commits to your branch to address feedback (they’ll automatically show up in the PR). We’ll work together to get your changes in good shape.
                <p>During review, I might also run automated checks (like tests or linters). If any checks fail, I’ll let you know. You can update your code and push again to fix those issues.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Merge:</strong> Once your PR is approved and any required checks pass, I will merge it into the main branch. Congratulations – your contribution is now part of the project! I’ll thank you for your contribution, and you’ll be listed as a contributor.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’re new to this process, don’t worry! It can feel a bit intimidating at first, but GitHub’s own guides and tools make it easier. In fact, GitHub has an example walk-through where they guide you through contributing to the <code>github/docs</code> repository, covering forking, making changes, and opening a PR<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/contributing-to-open-source" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">[docs.github.com]</a>. There are also beginner-friendly resources like <strong>firstcontributions.github.io</strong> that provide a step-by-step tutorial for making your first contribution<a href="https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">[github.com]</a>.</p>
<p>One important note: <strong>always make sure your branch is up to date with the latest changes</strong> from the original repository before opening a PR. You can do this by fetching from <code>upstream</code> and merging or rebasing. This helps avoid merge conflicts. For example:
        <pre><code>git fetch upstream
git rebase upstream/main</code></pre>
        This will rebase your branch on top of the latest <code>main</code> branch, incorporating any new changes.</p>
<p>By following these steps, you’ll submit a well-formed pull request. I appreciate your effort, and I’ll do my best to review it quickly. If you have any questions during this process, feel free to ask in the PR comments or via another channel – I’m here to help!</p>
<h2 id="section-5">How to Report an Issue</h2>
<p>If you encounter a problem with the project or have a suggestion, reporting it via an issue is greatly appreciated. Here’s how to create a helpful issue:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Check for Existing Issues:</strong> Before creating a new issue, search the Issues tab to see if the problem or request has already been reported. If you find a matching issue, you can add a comment to provide more information or simply indicate that you’re also experiencing it. This helps avoid duplicates.</li>
<li><strong>Open a New Issue:</strong> If the issue doesn’t exist yet, click the “New Issue” button on the Issues page. You may see issue templates if I’ve set them up (for example, a template for bug reports or feature requests). If so, choose the appropriate template. If not, proceed to create a blank issue.</li>
<li><strong>Fill in the Title and Description:</strong> Give the issue a <strong>clear and specific title</strong> that summarizes the problem or request. For example, “Bug: Application crashes when saving file” or “Feature Request: Add support for exporting to PDF”. In the description, provide as much detail as possible:
                <ul>
<li>If it’s a bug: Explain the steps to reproduce it (what did you do, what happened, what did you expect to happen?). Include any error messages or logs if available. Mention your environment (OS, version of the project, etc.) if relevant.</li>
<li>If it’s a feature request: Describe the feature in detail and why it would be useful. If you have ideas on how to implement it, feel free to share those too.</li>
</ul>
<p>The more information you provide, the easier it is for me to understand and address the issue.</p>
</li>
<li><strong>Add Labels (if possible):</strong> If you have permission or the interface allows, you can add relevant labels to the issue (like <code>bug</code>, <code>enhancement</code>, <code>documentation</code>, etc.). This helps categorize the issue. Even if you can’t add labels, don’t worry – I’ll label it appropriately after creation.</li>
<li><strong>Submit the Issue:</strong> Click “Submit new issue”. The issue will be created and I’ll receive a notification. I’ll try to respond promptly, either to ask for clarification or to start working on the problem.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example of a Good Bug Report:</strong>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> Bug: Login fails with “Invalid credentials” even with correct password</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Steps to reproduce:
            <ol>
<li>Open the app and go to login screen.</li>
<li>Enter a valid username and password that worked before.</li>
<li>Click Login.</li>
</ol>
            Expected: User logs in successfully.
            Actual: Error message “Invalid credentials” appears.
            This started happening after the latest update. I’ve tried resetting the password and it still doesn’t work. No error logs are shown in the console.
        </p>
</blockquote>
        This example is clear and provides context, which helps in debugging.</p>
<p>If you’re unsure how to write a good issue, GitHub’s own documentation recommends including a descriptive title and a detailed description of the problem versus expected behavior<a href="https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/147722" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">[github.com]</a>. They also suggest using issue templates to guide contributors in providing the necessary information<a href="https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/147722" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">[github.com]</a>. I may have templates set up (for instance, a bug report template might prompt you to fill out what happened, expected behavior, steps to reproduce, etc.). If so, please use them – they are designed to collect the info I need.</p>
<p>After submitting an issue, I might ask follow-up questions or provide updates. If I start working on it, I may assign myself or label it accordingly. If you’re interested in fixing the issue yourself, feel free to mention that in the issue – I can assign it to you or give guidance. Otherwise, I’ll handle it as soon as I can. Thanks for helping make the project better by reporting issues!</p>
<h2 id="section-6">How to Request a Feature</h2>
<p>If you have an idea for a new feature or an improvement to the project, I’d love to hear it! Feature requests are typically handled via GitHub Issues as well. Here’s how to go about requesting a feature:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Search for Existing Requests:</strong> First, check the Issues (and maybe Discussions) to see if someone else has already suggested the same feature. If there’s an existing issue, you can comment on it to add your support or additional ideas. This helps consolidate discussion.</li>
<li><strong>Open a New Issue:</strong> If your feature idea is new, create a new issue. You might use a “Feature Request” template if one is available, or just use a regular issue. In the title, clearly state the feature (e.g. “Feature: Add dark mode theme”).</li>
<li><strong>Describe the Feature:</strong> In the issue description, explain the feature in detail. What would it do? Why is it valuable? If possible, describe how you envision it working. For example, if it’s a UI feature, you might sketch what it looks like or describe user interactions. If it’s a new API or function, you might outline the proposed functionality.</li>
<li><strong>Provide Use Cases:</strong> It helps to explain the use case – who would use this feature and why. For instance, “As a user, I want a dark mode so that I can use the app in low-light environments without eye strain.” This context helps me understand the importance.</li>
<li><strong>If you plan to implement it:</strong> If you’re willing and able to work on this feature yourself, mention that! You can say something like, “I’d like to work on this feature if it’s approved.” This is great because it means you might contribute the code as well. I’ll be happy to discuss design and give feedback as you develop it.</li>
<li><strong>Discuss and Refine:</strong> I’ll respond to the feature request issue to discuss it. We might go back and forth to clarify requirements or explore how to integrate the feature with the existing codebase. Community input is welcome too – other users might chime in with their thoughts.</li>
<li><strong>Decision and Next Steps:</strong> After discussion, I’ll decide whether to proceed with the feature. If it aligns with the project’s goals, I’ll mark it as accepted and possibly assign it or create a task for it. If I’m not sure or if it needs more work, I might ask for a proof-of-concept or say I’ll consider it for a future release. In some cases, if the feature doesn’t fit the project’s direction, I’ll explain why and we can part ways amicably – but I’ll always appreciate the suggestion.</li>
</ol>
<p>Feature requests are a way to shape the project’s future, so I take them seriously. Even if I can’t implement every idea immediately, I’ll keep them in mind. Sometimes, if an idea is big, I might break it down into smaller issues or ask for help implementing parts of it.</p>
<p>One thing to note: <strong>if you intend to implement the feature yourself</strong>, it’s very helpful to get my feedback on the design before you start coding. You can do this by discussing in the issue or even opening a draft pull request with your initial thoughts. This way, we can agree on an approach and avoid you spending time on something that might not fit. As GitHub’s guide suggests, you should “open an issue outlining your proposed approach before investing significant development time” for new features<a href="https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/exploring-projects-on-github/finding-ways-to-contribute-to-open-source-on-github" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">[docs.github.com]</a>.</p>
<p>Thank you for your ideas! They help the project grow. Whether or not a feature gets implemented, I appreciate you taking the time to share it. If I don’t respond right away, it’s probably just because I’m busy, but I will get back to you.</p>
<h2 id="section-7">Code Review Process</h2>
<p>Once you submit a pull request, it will go through a code review process. Here’s what you can expect and how you can help make it smooth:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Initial Triage:</strong> I’ll take a look at your PR shortly after it’s submitted. I may add some labels (like <code>needs review</code> or <code>work in progress</code> if it’s a draft) and assign it to myself or another reviewer. If there are any obvious issues (for example, if the PR is incomplete or if there are merge conflicts), I’ll mention those in a comment.</li>
<li><strong>In-Depth Review:</strong> I’ll review your code change by line. I’ll check for correctness, style consistency, potential bugs, and whether it aligns with the project’s goals. I might ask questions like “Could you explain this part?” or point out possible improvements. Please don’t take these personally – they’re meant to improve the code and help you grow as a developer. My goal is to work <em>with</em> you to make the contribution as good as it can be.</li>
<li><strong>Iteration:</strong> After my review, I’ll leave comments or feedback. You’ll need to address these comments. This might involve making additional changes to your code or simply clarifying your approach. You can push new commits to your branch – they’ll automatically appear in the PR. I encourage you to respond to each comment (either by making the change or explaining why you think it’s not needed). This creates a dialogue. For example, if I suggest a code improvement, you might implement it and reply “Done” to that comment. This helps me track what’s been addressed.</li>
<li><strong>Approvals:</strong> If everything looks good and I’m satisfied with the changes, I’ll mark the PR as approved. In some cases, especially for larger changes, I might ask another maintainer or community member to review as well. If there are multiple maintainers, I might require a certain number of approvals before merging.</li>
<li><strong>Merge:</strong> Once approved and any required checks pass (like tests passing, CI checks, etc.), I’ll merge your PR into the main branch. I’ll usually do a “Squash and Merge” or a normal merge depending on what’s best for the git history. After merging, I’ll close any linked issues and thank you for your contribution in the PR comments.</li>
<li><strong>Post-Merge:</strong> After merging, your changes will be part of the project. If you’d like, you can check out the latest version of the main branch to see your code in action. I’ll also update documentation or release notes if needed to reflect your change.</li>
</ul>
<p>During the review, feel free to ask questions if my feedback is unclear. I’m happy to explain my reasoning. Remember that code review is a learning process – for both of us. Even if I request changes, it doesn’t mean your work is bad; it’s just part of refining it to meet the project’s standards.</p>
<p>To make the review process efficient, here are a few tips for you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Keep PRs focused:</strong> Try to make each PR address one issue or feature. A smaller, well-scoped PR is easier to review than a huge one with many unrelated changes. If you have multiple things to contribute, consider submitting separate PRs for each.</li>
<li><strong>Test your changes:</strong> If possible, test the code you’re submitting. If there are existing tests, run them to make sure nothing broke. If you added a new feature, consider writing a test for it (if applicable). This gives me more confidence in your change.</li>
<li><strong>Follow style guidelines:</strong> I may have coding style or formatting guidelines (these might be in <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> or inferred from the existing code). Following them will reduce the number of style-related comments I need to make.</li>
<li><strong>Be responsive:</strong> The sooner you can address review comments, the faster the PR can be merged. I understand you might be busy, but a prompt response keeps the momentum going. If you won’t be able to work on it for a while, just let me know so I’m aware.</li>
</ul>
<p>By working together during the review, we’ll ensure that the code merged is high-quality and beneficial to the project. I’m really grateful for your contribution, and I want to make sure it’s properly integrated. Thanks for your patience and cooperation during this process!</p>
<h2 id="section-8">Community Expectations and Code of Conduct</h2>
<p>Contributing to an open source project is not just about writing code – it’s also about being part of a community. I strive to maintain a friendly, inclusive, and respectful environment for everyone. To ensure that, I have a <strong>Code of Conduct</strong> that all participants are expected to follow.</p>
<p>The Code of Conduct outlines what behaviors are acceptable and what are not in our community. In short, we expect everyone to be <strong>respectful and considerate</strong> towards others. Examples of positive behavior include using welcoming language, being respectful of differing viewpoints, gracefully accepting constructive criticism, focusing on what is best for the community, and showing empathy towards other members<a href="https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/b24679402957c63ec426" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">[gist.github.com]</a>. In contrast, unacceptable behavior includes things like harassment, insults, discriminatory language, or any form of personal attack<a href="https://gist.github.com/PurpleBooth/b24679402957c63ec426" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">[gist.github.com]</a>. Such behavior will not be tolerated.</p>
<p>As a contributor, you are responsible for adhering to this Code of Conduct in all your interactions related to the project – whether that’s in issues, pull requests, discussions, or any other platform we use. If you see someone violating the Code of Conduct, or if you have any concerns, please let me (the maintainer) know. I take reports seriously and will address them promptly. My goal is to keep this community a safe and enjoyable space for everyone to collaborate.</p>
<p>By contributing, you’re not only helping the project technically but also helping foster a healthy community. I appreciate your understanding and cooperation in this regard. Let’s work together to be kind, patient, and supportive. Remember that open source communities thrive when people treat each other well.</p>
<p>If you haven’t already, I encourage you to read the full Code of Conduct document (often named <code>CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md</code> in the repository) to familiarize yourself with the guidelines. It usually includes how to report violations and what consequences may follow for unacceptable behavior. Following these guidelines will make your experience and others’ experiences more positive.</p>
<p>Thank you for being a responsible member of the community. I’m excited to work with you!</p>
